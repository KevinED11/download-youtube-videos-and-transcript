She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene I said, don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one Who would dance on the floor in the round? She said, I am the one Who would dance on the floor in the round? She told me her name was Billie Jean And she caused a scene, then her heavy hair turned into ice She dreamed of being the one Who would dance on the floor in the round? People always told me, be careful what you do Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts And mother always told me, be careful who you love Be careful what you do, cause the love that comes with you Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one But the kid is not my son For forty days and for forty nights I was on her side But who can stand when she's in demand Her schemes never lands Who would dance on the floor in the round? So take my strong advice Just remember to always think twice Do think twice She told my baby, dance to three She looked at me, then showed a photo Baby cried, his eyes were like mine Who would dance on the floor in the round, baby? People always told me, be careful what you do Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts But she came and stood right by me Just the smell of sweet perfume This heaven must be soon She's going to her home Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one But the kid is not my son Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one You know what you did You did this, girl, so you're breaking my heart, babe She says I am the one Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover
